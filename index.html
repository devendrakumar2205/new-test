Medicaid is jointly funded at the state and federal levels. Medicaid supports low-income individuals and families by covering costs associated with both medical and long-term custodial care for those who qualify. Some of the benefits covered under Medicaid overlap with Medicare, such as inpatient and outpatient hospital care and doctor services. However, depending on the state, Medicaid may also offer coverage that is not included under Original Medicare, such as personal care, optometry services, and dental services. Also, the service providers (such as hospitals and doctors) available to people using Medicaid are often different than those available to people using Medicares <br><br>

Eligibility for Medicaid is means-based, and the program has strict income eligibility requirements that vary from state to state. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility levels in some states beginning on January 1, 2014. For more information on current qualification requirements, individuals should call their State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) office or visit Medicaid.gov. <br><br>
